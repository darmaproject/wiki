## Introduction

This is a simplified version of rpc documentation which is mostly helpful for exchanges.

All methods use the same JSON RPC interface. For example:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:33805/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"make_integrated_address","params":{}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Note: "atomic units" refer to the smallest fraction of 1 DMCH according to the darmad implementation. **1 DMCH = 1e8 atomic units.**

### get_transfers

Retrieve the transfer details.

Inputs:

## Useful Tips:

### tip1
### Suggestions on how exchanges scan transaction recordsï¼š

- Continuously scan transaction records according to the latest block height, call the get_transfers method to scan the transaction records (set the pending parameter to true), if there is a new transaction "A", then it is the received transaction "A" in  pending status.
- When the block height changes, get the "stableheight" from get_info, if the block height of transaction A is less than "stableheight", then the transaction "A" is mature.
- Call the get_transfer_by_txid method to confirm whether the transaction "A" is on the chain. If it is on the chain, then the transaction "A" is confirmed/valid.

Example:

get_transfers returned value:

{"id":"1"
"jsonrpc":"2.0"
"result":{"in":[{"index_global":992678
"tx_hash":"467cbd2e9c87d525d735ac9dc3f4c66da6c69a51dc02e9feaf5b34feada1ad20"
"block_hash":"7c0ec164495f71aea3d82948ff22470a98598ec02e6ed5dff4108838e6ff2b1f"
"block_height":229331
"topo_height":314426
â€¦â€¦
}

get_info returned value:

{"id":"1111111"
"jsonrpc":"2.0"
"result":{"alt_blocks_count":0
"difficulty":2766709637
"grey_peerlist_size":0
"height":238617
"stableheight":238609
"topoheight":325946
â€¦â€¦
}

"block_height":229331 < "stableheight":238609 = tx is confirmed/valid.

### tip2
### Initiate multiple withdrawals at one time

The transfer method can construct multiple vouts in the same transaction to realize simultaneous transfer to multiple different destination addresses (a single transaction can have up to 7 destination addresses). Please refer to "https://github.com/darmaproject/wiki/blob/master/Wallet-RPC-Documentation.md#transfer"
